The best aGPS solution is the customized build.  In almost every instance, it provides rapid 
GPS response times and accuracy over the standard version of this patch and almost always provides 
quicker locks over standard device configurations.  It can also bring about longer battery 
life because the GPS module doesn't need to stress on active power searching for GPS satellites 
for long periods of time.

<p><b>What's different:<br />
1.</b><br />The almanac data file is pulled directly from my content delivery system.  
The placement of this file is on premium networks with plenty of bandwidth to spare.  
Further, errors are corrected in this almanac compared to that provided by your phone 
manufacturer.  The manufacturer server is continuously overloaded, with high latency, and has been 
unavailable numerous times.  This means that it could take minutes to get the almanac 
data for the GPS satellites.  My servers provide it within a couple of seconds.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b><br />The standard patch uses <i>NTP.ORG</i> pools servers.  People misunderstand the concept 
NTP time servers and falsely believe that the closer the server, the better for them.  
<i>NTP.ORG</i> is made up of servers from around the world, many of which are on cable modems 
and home-based servers.  This means there will be lag-time and network routing problems 
to get your NTP sync.  My NTP pool only contains Stratum II time servers.  These servers 
are strategically placed around the world and are what financial and technological institutions 
as well as governments use to ensure worldwide synchronization.

<p>
These two concepts rolled into one can reduce the time required to get a GPS lock within a 
few meters of your location by as much as one minute.  Many users report "instantaneous 
locks" which translates into about three seconds.
